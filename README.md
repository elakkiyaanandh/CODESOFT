# 📝 Simple To-Do List Application (Python)

##  Description

This project is a **Simple To-Do List Application** developed using **Python** as part of my **internship at CodeSoft**. The application helps users manage and organize their daily tasks efficiently using a **menu-driven command-line interface (CLI)**.

The project supports basic task management operations such as adding tasks, viewing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks. Task data is stored permanently using a **JSON file**, ensuring data persistence even after the program is closed.
